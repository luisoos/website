## What is this blog for?

I always like to look back at the thoughts I had a few days, a couple of months or years ago. And why not make them accessible to everyone?

Moreover, I think it is a great project I can always “work” on. If some people on the internet find my content helpful or interesting, that's even better.

Also, I think I need to practice writing. Learning Latin in school destroyed my ability to build good sentences. Even though I already read more, I think maintaining this blog could have a good side effect.
